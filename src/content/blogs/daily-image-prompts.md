1. (Grip): head and arms are physically popping out OVER the top and side thin borders. hands are realistically gripping the outer edges of the thin side borders, appearing to hold the frame firmly.
2. (Resting): She is looking directly at the camera with a gentle smile. Her head and shoulders physically pop out OVER the top thin white border. Crucially, her hands are realistically resting, appearing to lean casually on the frame edge.
3. (Dynamic Frame): Her upper body and head remain secure WITHIN the boundaries of the white frame. However, both of her arms are fully extended outward dynamically, breaking past the thin borders up to her elbows, reaching straight toward the camera lens.

Subject Dimensionality & Texture: The subject must look like a solid, three-dimensional figure, not flat. Emphasize the detailed texture, the contours of the face, and realistic hair details.

```markdown
1. **Localized Editing / Select & Refine:** Select and refine only the subject of the scene. The process should preserve all edges while it makes details more visible and it should modify the shape slightly but it should not touch the surrounding area. The lighting and color elements should maintain their authentic appearance. The subject needs gentle adjustments to become more prominent while keeping the entire image realistic.
2. **Camera Angle Adjustment:** The same scene needs to be reenacted by moving the camera 15° above its original position to achieve a semi-top-down viewing angle. The scene needs to keep its lighting effects and color scheme consistent while the artist should make sure the new view shows realistic depth and shadows and proper perspective.
3. **Change Focus / Depth of Field:** The photographer should reframe the image to make the foreground objects appear perfectly clear while the background elements fade into a professional-looking soft focus. The main subject should receive prominent emphasis through shallow depth-of-field while preserving the original colors and lighting of the image.
4. **Color Grading:** The film receives a sophisticated color treatment which draws from contemporary cinematic styles. The image should display soft teal shadows and warm highlights which should not affect the natural appearance of skin tones. The image needs gentle contrast enhancement to achieve a clean polished look which suits premium branding requirements.
5. **Lighting Transformation (Day → Night):** The entire scene needs to shift from daytime to a genuine nighttime environment. The scene requires soft moonlight highlights together with cool shadows and warm artificial light sources and delicate reflection effects. The mood should create an authentic experience which transports the audience into the story.
6. **Lighting Transformation (Bokeh Effect):** The main subject needs to stay completely sharp while the background should turn into a dreamy soft bokeh. The camera should use circular blurred lights together with warm tones and a gentle glow to achieve a cinematic night portrait effect.

## 🎨 Design, Branding & UI

### 🎨 Brand Visual Storyboard

![Brand Visual Storyboard](/blog-images/Brand_Visual_Story_Board.jpeg)

**Context:** High-end Product Presentation & Branding

<details>
<summary>Click to view prompt</summary>

```markdown
Create a brand visual storyboard for presenting your product with Nano Banana Pro:

Create ONE final image.

A clean 3×3 [ratio] storyboard grid with nine equal [ratio] sized panels on [4:5] ratio.

Use the reference image as the base product reference. Keep the same product, packaging design, branding, materials, colors, proportions and overall identity across all nine panels exactly as the reference. The product must remain clearly recognizable in every frame. The label, logo and proportions must stay exactly the same.

This storyboard is a high-end designer mockup presentation for a branding portfolio. The focus is on form, composition, materiality and visual rhythm rather than realism or lifestyle narrative. The overall look should feel curated, editorial and design-driven.

FRAME 1:
Front-facing hero shot of the product in a clean studio setup. Neutral background, balanced composition, calm and confident presentation of the product.

FRAME 2:
Close-up shot with the focus centered on the middle of the product. Focusing on surface texture, materials and print details.

FRAME 3:
Shows the reference product placed in an environment that naturally fits the brand and product category. Studio setting inspired by the product design elements and colours.

FRAME 4:
Product shown in use or interaction on a neutral studio background. Hands and interaction elements are minimal and restrained, the look matches the style of the package.

FRAME 5:
Isometric composition showing multiple products arranged in a precise geometric order from the top isometric angle. All products are placed at the same isometric top angle, evenly spaced, clean, structured and graphic.

FRAME 6:
Product levitating slightly tilted on a neutral background that matches the reference image color palette. Floating position is angled and intentional, the product is floating naturally in space.

FRAME 7:
is an extreme close-up focusing on a specific detail of the label, edge, texture or material behavior.

FRAME 8:
The product in an unexpected yet aesthetically strong setting that feels bold, editorial and visually striking.
Unexpected but highly stylized setting. Studio-based, and designer-driven. Bold composition that elevates the brand.

FRAME 9:
Wide composition showing the product in use, placed within a refined designer setup. Clean props, controlled styling, cohesive with the rest of the series.

CAMERA & STYLE:
Ultra high-quality studio imagery with a real camera look. Different camera angles and framings across frames. Controlled depth of field, precise lighting, accurate materials and reflections. Lighting logic, color palette, mood and visual language must remain consistent across all nine panels as one cohesive series.

OUTPUT:
A clean 3×3 grid with no borders, no text, no captions and no watermarks.
