### 📝 The Reverse Brief Prompt
**Context:** Strategic Problem Definition & Clarity
```markdown
I want to achieve [describe the outcome you think you want].
Do not give me strategies, steps, frameworks, or advice yet.
Before proposing any solution, your only task is to deeply understand the problem.

Start by asking me exactly 5 high-quality clarifying questions that help uncover:

Constraints
– limits around time, budget, tools, skills, authority, or external dependencies

Resources
– people, tools, data, budget, audience, systems, or leverage I already have access to

Timeline & urgency
– deadlines, milestones, and whether speed or quality matters more

Success criteria
– how success will be measured, what “done” actually looks like, and what would make this a clear win

The real objective
– identify whether my stated goal is a proxy for a deeper or different outcome (e.g., status, revenue, freedom, validation, risk reduction)

Rules:
Ask the questions one at a time, in logical order
Make each question specific, non-generic, and decision-shaping
Challenge assumptions if something sounds vague or misaligned
Do not suggest solutions, tactics, or examples until all 5 questions are answered
```

### 🏢 Build a Strong Company Culture

Guidance on defining and reinforcing core values and ethical standards that guide daily behavior, decision-making, and alignment with the company’s mission.

Team-building ideas and rituals that strengthen relationships, improve communication, and create a sense of belonging.

A recognition and rewards system that consistently acknowledges high performance, impact, and behaviors aligned with company values.
