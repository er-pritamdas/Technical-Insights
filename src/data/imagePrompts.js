      "**Localized Editing / Select & Refine:** Select and refine only the subject of the scene. The process should preserve all edges while it makes details more visible and it should modify the shape slightly but it should not touch the surrounding area. The lighting and color elements should maintain their authentic appearance. The subject needs gentle adjustments to become more prominent while keeping the entire image realistic.",
      "**Camera Angle Adjustment:** The same scene needs to be reenacted by moving the camera 15° above its original position to achieve a semi-top-down viewing angle. The scene needs to keep its lighting effects and color scheme consistent while the artist should make sure the new view shows realistic depth and shadows and proper perspective.",
      "**Change Focus / Depth of Field:** The photographer should reframe the image to make the foreground objects appear perfectly clear while the background elements fade into a professional-looking soft focus. The main subject should receive prominent emphasis through shallow depth-of-field while preserving the original colors and lighting of the image.",
      "**Color Grading:** The film receives a sophisticated color treatment which draws from contemporary cinematic styles. The image should display soft teal shadows and warm highlights which should not affect the natural appearance of skin tones. The image needs gentle contrast enhancement to achieve a clean polished look which suits premium branding requirements.",
      "**Lighting Transformation (Day → Night):** The entire scene needs to shift from daytime to a genuine nighttime environment. The scene requires soft moonlight highlights together with cool shadows and warm artificial light sources and delicate reflection effects. The mood should create an authentic experience which transports the audience into the story.",
      "**Lighting Transformation (Bokeh Effect):** The main subject needs to stay completely sharp while the background should turn into a dreamy soft bokeh. The camera should use circular blurred lights together with warm tones and a gentle glow to achieve a cinematic night portrait effect."
